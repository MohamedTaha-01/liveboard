>The app received positive feedback, with particular praise for its user interface and overall functionality.

## What is LiveBoard?

> The problem: Disconnected planning
>
> - _Planning with teams can be chaotic, especially when trying to brainstorm or visualize ideas remotely._
> - _Physical whiteboards have always been great for sharing ideas, but they are restrictive when working online._
> - _What if teams could work on a live board together?_
>
> The goal: Provide a system for teams or individuals to brainstorm and plan together in real-time.
